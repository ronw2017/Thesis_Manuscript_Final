\section{Conclusion}
\indent In conclusion, I have used this methodology to prove that given the data set and strength of the test there is a possibility that distinguishing between aerial manmade objects and aerial biological objects. Using Boolean image multiplication, I was able to produce data to indicate steady state ratios may be used in categorical classification of aerial objects to identify aerial biological objects from manmade aerial objects. The system has the potential to increase flight path efficiency by granting the ability of identifying and omitting benign aerial threats. Supplementary effects of flight path efficiency may include improvements in energy and time efficiency as well as extending UAS vehicle lifespan longevity and each deserve further study in the wake of the current study.
