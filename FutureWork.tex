\section{Future Work}
\indent Future study of Boolean image multiplication should include further noise reduction and a different method of object positioning. Noise reduction and object positioning are an important part of the frame preparation before the Boolean image multiplication process.
\indent Improvement in noise reduction with histogram equalization and adaptive thresholding would improve the contrast of the original frame eliminating shadows and glares on the object from the sun that would have a significant effect on the object profile

as in Figure 2, during the binary thresholding process and adaptive thresholding with a bias towards darker pixels. 
Active object tracking to substitute the simulated object tracking in the study should be used in future studies. The use of an automatic system for this purpose allows for a wider range of samples and more reliable data collection. The improvement has application in simulation and field testing for a system such as a UAS sense and avoid system.
